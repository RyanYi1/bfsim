# Brave Frontier Summon Simulator
NOTE: This project is discontinued, but the idea will remain. I have decided to create a new app with the same general idea as this project, but it will not be restricted to Brave Frontier. Please check out [my new Github project instead](https://github.com/RyanYi1/WhyNot)

Side Project that simulates summoning for a unit in Brave Frontier. Currently the application is outdated.

Right now it has:

-Can summon about 4 units

-Add custom units with custom images

Needs:

-More Units

-Omni Rank
